# NYP Piano Ensemble Website
By Ryan Kok

The purpose of the website was to advertise the NYP Piano Ensemble Club, and encourage newcomers to join, as well as to provide general information on the club.

The main style of the website is inspired by minimalist, and I prioritised keeping consistent quality and a consistent look among pages.

### Main design inspirations include:
- NTUPE: https://ntupe.weebly.com/
- Several open sourced projects on github for small inspirations
