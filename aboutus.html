    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>The NYP Piano Ensemble's mission is to nurture and grow its membersâ€™ musical passion and support aspiring musicians. Musicians are encouraged to explore their own styles and forms of music and performances, as well as peer teach amongst the members. Members have opportunities to learn the theory behind the instrument and put all the learning into practice through various events and shows throughout the year. The club welcomes musicians with experience, as well as new musicians. </p>
